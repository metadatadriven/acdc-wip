# CDISC 360i Phase 2 (AC/DC) F2F meeting notes

## Review of EU Connect presentation

TODO: add notes

## Kirsten review of 'Phrase' approach

- bubble diagram of ADAS-Cog analysis from sentence to dataset vars
- Sentence -> Concept -> Implementation
- Relationships will need to be defined
- discussion on ADaM "class" vars: similar but not same as Role in SDTM
- discussion how generic or specialised AC concept attributes and relationships can be?..
- is everything a generic AC_PROPERTY or can we specialise them?
- These can be defined as templates

## Way forward?

- identify 5 analyses to be used as test cases
- work these through the different approaches to allow compare/contract
- identify some core concepts

## Notes to self
- could we have a LinkML->Thunderstruck exporter??
